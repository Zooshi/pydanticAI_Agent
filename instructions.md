We want to build a Python Streamlet application which allows the user to interact with a Gen AI agent. This agent is based on PydanticAI framework. The user has the option to choose between two models. He can either use an open-source OLLAMA model, which is running locally on a Windows computer. The model is "qwen3:8b". Alternatively, he can use OpenAI Model "gpt-4.1-mini" for the pydanticAI Agent. The agent has two tools:

1. The finance tool which uses the free YFinance API to fetch the latest stock price for a given ticker.
2. The research tool which uses Tavily to fetch the latest information from the Internet, based on the user query.

The agent itself can either answer the user prompt by its trained knowledge or by using one of the tools. If the agent uses one of the tools, it should specifically mention it, so it is transparent to the user in the front-end. The answer should always be streamed back to the user. Also, in a front-end should see the prior conversation he has during a session. If we start a new session, then all history is gone. We do not save it. We also make sure that the user interactions are tracked. Therefore, we use LogFire, which has a built-in implementation in Pydantic AI framework, in order to track the conversations with the large language model. The API keys will be provided, so just ensure that we have a sample.inv file during the project creation. Also, Omega is installed, and the model is also available, so nothing to do on that side either. If there is anything unclear regarding the project instructions, there is missing information or ambiguity, then ask first clarifying questions and ensure you use your subagents for the implementation correctly.
